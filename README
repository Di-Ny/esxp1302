README

This is the ESP32 platform porting of SX1302_HAL project (https://github.com/Lora-net/sx1302_hal), based on the Version 1.0.5.
I try to stick to the original code as much as possible, but also removed some line-seperating comments I think not necessary.
And when involving ESP32 unique features, I have to invent my own way, which also imported some difference.


How to Compile

First, you need ESP32 development environment "esp-idf". You can get it from https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.
Please follow the guide to install the SDK as well as the tools.
Below are the simplified steps for Linux platform:
```
mkdir ~/esp
cd ~/esp
git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
cd esp-idf
# git checkout v4.0  # optional; this is the status I used for early development
# git checkout 4a011f31  # optional; this is the status after I upgraded the esp-idf with commit '8b9050a' at 2021-12-03.
./install.sh  # install the compilers etc.
. export.sh   # export and set up the environment
```

Then you can compile this project by first change to the project folder, and use `./run_it.sh` to build and flash it.
Run `./run_it.sh -h` for its usage.
This script can compile the code, flash the ESP32 board, and open 'minicom' to monitor the output, so make sure your ESP32 board is connected.
If you are not under Linux, you need to change `run_it.sh` to use other terminal tool instead or just run your terminal tool manually.

Configurations

There are some compile targets indeed, just as under the original sx1302_hal project under "libloragw/tst/test_*".
But you have to choose only one for compilation by change the file 'main/main.c', which is a symbol link to one of test/test_* files.
The default is test/lora_pkt_fwd.c, but you can change to others such as test/test_loragw_hal_rx.c before you run 'run_it.sh'.

Usage

At the terminal, you should be able to input the command with your argument of option, such as:
```
test_loragw_hal_tx -r 1250 -c 0 -f 505.5 --pwid 22 -b 125 -n 20
test_loragw_hal_tx -r 1250 -c 0 -f 505.5 --pwid 22 -b 125 -n 20 -m CW
test_network_connection -u wireless_ssid -p wireless_password --host 192.168.1.200 --port 2000
pkt_fwd -u wireless_ssid -p wireless_password --host 192.168.1.200 --port 1680
```


Issues and TODOs

There are some issues need to be fixed, and more features under development.

Below is the list of some of them:
1. A few test targets do no work: test_loragw_cal.c, test_loragw_counter.c, test_loragw_capture_ram.c and test_loragw_gps.c.
2. GPS can output raw data with the module "ATGM336H" but hasn't been fully verified yet.
3. Configuration from web site using ESP32 Wifi as Soft AP and web server still ongoing.
