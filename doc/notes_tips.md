Below are some notes and tips of the gateway usage.

- The command line only supports wifi and ns settings and gateway id. For other settings, you have to use the web UI.
- The web UI has some check for the values provided by user to avoid wrong values by accident or ignorance.
- If user know what he/she is doing, and wants to provide some "wrong" values to the gateway, he/she can disable Javascript in the browser, or provide the values from the command line.
  Still, there are some checks exists for either of these 2 ways to provide some safety.
