# Todo List

Below are the items could be done in the next milestone (Phase 3) or even further future.

- A simple online user guide (just a page linked to the web UI).
- improve the safety of Wifi by hiding the password and encrypt both ssid and password. Also the password should not be seen in the log.
- Make use the GPS raw data; could be useful for Class B.
- Support user to reset both the username/password of the web UI login and for Soft AP mode.
- Reset to default: can reset the web UI and Soft AP mode username/password, as well as clean all the configs.
- Provide an online help and can be accessed from the web UI.
- Provide a way to import json file (either from web UI or some other way).
- code clean.
- backport the fixes from sx1302\_hal project.


# Issue List

Below is the list about some limitations or issues of the front-end interface of this gateway.
Some could be fixed in the future, but not all of them.

- "NS Host" only works with IP address, doesn't work with Domain name.
- Wifi username and password only work with ASCII characters, doesn't support other UTF-8 characters.
