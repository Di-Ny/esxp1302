# Todo List

Below are potential improvements (contributions are welcome):

- A simple online user guide (just a page linked to the web UI).
- improve the safety of Wifi by encrypting both ssid and password.
- Support user to reset both the username/password of the web UI login and for Soft AP mode.
- Reset to default: can reset the web UI and Soft AP mode username/password, as well as clean all the configs.
- Provide an online help and can be accessed from the web UI.
- Provide a way to import json file (either from web UI or some other way).
- GPS can output raw data with the module **ATGM336H** but hasn't been fully verified yet.
- Verify/update/merge test code under `main/libloragw-test/` and `main/test`.


# Issue List

Below are limitations or issues of the gateway:

- Wifi username and password only work with ASCII characters, doesn't support other UTF-8 characters.
